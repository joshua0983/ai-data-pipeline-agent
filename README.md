# AI Data Pipeline Agent
Intelligent Data Unification powered by AI Agents

## Overview
This project develops an AI Data Pipeline Agent, a smart software system designed to tackle the common challenge of messy, scattered data in organizations. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate and intelligently manage the process of bringing together, cleaning, and transforming data from various sources (like spreadsheets, databases, and APIs) into a single, unified, and clean format.

The agent understands natural language commands, plans data operations, and executes them using a set of specialized tools. This makes data preparation much more efficient and reliable, helping businesses get their data ready for powerful analytics and AI applications.

## Key Focus
This project showcases robust software engineering practices combined with cutting-edge AI integration to solve real-world data problems.
